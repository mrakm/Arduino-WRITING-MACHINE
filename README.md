# Arduino WRITING MACHINE

## INTRODUCTION:- 
In this system we will make a plotter which can write with pencil or pen. This machine can be controlled with android app.And can be taken in use in many industries as well as in household to write and make hand made sketch.

## OBJECTIVE:- 
In industries and colleges we often encounter situation in which one person have to sign many documents.In such situation this machine can be taken in use with an artificial intelligence machine to sign the document intelligently .
OPERATIONAL DEFINITION:- The main heart of this writing machine is Arduino UNO R3 ,Arduino CNC Shield V3  to pins of arduino  to interact with  x y motor connected to it.A servo motor is connected to the pins of the CNC shield to control the servo motor.
